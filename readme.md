Learning rate decides the rate that which the loss function reaches at minima. If the learning rate is very small, it take more steps and hence greater time to approach minima and vice-versa.Clearly as the learning rate increases the loss function converges faster to the minima but we have to be cautious with high learning rate as it may result in skipping the minima. In our case
